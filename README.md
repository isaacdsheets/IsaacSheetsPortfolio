# Isaac Sheets
#Hi, my name is Isaac Sheets. I'm a mechanical engineer at the University of Louisville, with a huge passion for engineering. I love engineering and want to push my knowledge further. I'm super friendly, work really well with others, love problem solving, I love to keep the atmosphere lighthearted while also doing quality and efficient work, and I also have lots of leadership experience. This is my portfolio for everything I've done from High-School, College, and a lot of stuff that I love to do in my free time. I hope you enjoy exploring this portfolio.
